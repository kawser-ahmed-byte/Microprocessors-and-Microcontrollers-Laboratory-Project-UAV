# TritonZ: A Remotely Operated Underwater Rover  
## Designed for Exploration and Rescue Operations  

Welcome to the repository for **TritonZ**, our **Remotely Operated Underwater Rover (ROV)** with a manipulator arm for versatile underwater exploration and rescue tasks. This project was developed as part of our **Microprocessors & Microcontrollers Laboratory Course** under the supervision of **Fahim Hafiz** and presented at **ICCIT 2024**.
